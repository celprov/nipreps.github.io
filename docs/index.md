# NeuroImaging PREProcessing toolS (NiPreps)

*NiPreps* **augment the scanner to produce data *directly consumable* by analyses**.

We refer to data *directly consumable by analyses* as ***analysis-grade data*** by analogy with the concept of "*sushi-grade (or [sashimi-grade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimi)) fish*" in that both are products that have been:

  * **minimally preprocessed**, but are
  * **safe to consume** directly.
